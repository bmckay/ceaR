Description: The ceaR package provides a set of tools that can be used
    to define a cost-effectiveness model based on either mean cost and effect
    data by intervention or alternative or patient-level data for two or more
    interventions or alternatives. Functions exist to calculate incremental
    cost-effectiveness ratios, confidence intervals, bootstrapping, net
    benefit regression, and create a variety of common plots.
